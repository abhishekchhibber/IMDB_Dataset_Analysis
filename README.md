# IMDB Dataset Analysis
## Analysis of IMDB dataset from Kaggle

In this project, I have analyzed the IMDB dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset), to answer the following queries:

* Which genres got maximum >= 7 ratings?
* Which genres are most profitable?
* Average duration / genre
* Thrillers and Mysteries produced / year after 2005


The code and analysis is in the [.ipynb file: imdb_db_analysis_abhishek_chhibber.ipynb](https://github.com/abhishekchhibber/IMDB_Dataset_Analysis/blob/master/imdb_db_analysis_abhishek_chhibber.ipynb)
